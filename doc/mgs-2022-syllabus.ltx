\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Objectives}


There are several objectives of this course:
\begin{description}
\item[Mathematics:] Ameliorate your love for Mathematics.
\item[Computer Science:] Develop competence in functional
  programming.
\item[Communication:] Explain and confidently defend your ideas.
\end{description}

The mathematical and computer science topics have been chosen for this
course complement each other.  You will enforce what you've learned by
explaining it to your peers.


It is important that the leaders of tomorrow, especially the leaders
in the technology sector, understand the impact on humans of
technological development.  We must know how to apply abstract
concepts to real computation problems, and how to explain their ideas
and defend their decisions to their peers.

Don't forget that you are working not only with machines but also with
humans.  In this course, we will maintain a respectful, inclusive, and
safe environment.  Remember that different people have different
strengths and weaknesses.  Scientific discussions can sometimes become
heated and experts might disagree about the best course of action.
We'll learn to keep disagreements objective and use science to test
ideas, rather than relying on emotions.

Good ideas that are never explained die and are forgotten.  It is my
belief that you don't understand something until you can explain it.
After each unit, some students will present their solutions to their
peers.  This means defending your choices, recognizing strengths and
shortcomings, and being subjected to peer review (important in the
scientific process).  This exercise is intended not only to learn to
accept constructive criticism but also to build confidence.

\subsection{Overview}

We will proceed through up to 6 units. Each unit is organized in three
stages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Theory --- Learn mathematics and computer science concepts.
\item Lab --- Implement code relating to the theory and link it to
  previous units.
\item Presentation --- Present your work to your classmates, and
  defend your decisions.
  \end{itemize}

\end{figure}

We will primarily cover introductions to two mathematical areas:
Abstract Algebra and Calculus.  Our practical treatment of Abstract
Algebra and Calculus will help you prepare for a more theoretical
treatment at the university level.
  
We will use a functional programming language called Scala,
\url{https://www.scala-lang.org}.  Functional languages are considered
by some to be more difficult than imperative languages, and students
rarely start programming using a functional language.  We have chosen
this approach, because the approach we will take will parallel many
mathematical concepts.  You will be able to take the things you've
learned and apply them back to other (more popular) programming
languages such as Python, Java Script, Lisp, C++, etc.

\section{Development Flow}

\subsection{GitHub}


In this course we will be developing software together.   You will be able to
share your code with your classmates, and with the world.  However, you control
when you want to make your code available to the world, and when you want to
incorporate your classmate's code into your development area.

To achieve this goal we have a central repository of code, hosted by
GitHub on the cloud.  You will download a copy of this repository,
edit existing code, and create new code, and then upload your
contributions back to the central repository, making your
contributions available to everyone else.

  \caption{GitHub is a remote (cloud) service service which hosts a git repository, allowing
  read/write access from local git clients.}
\end{figure}
GitHub is a web based service which hosts projects, small and large, in a cloud.
Typically, users have a development environment on their local computer
(laptop or desktop) and periodically upload and download changes to
the cloud.

The URL \url{https://github.com/jimka2001/mgs-2022}, is the public
entry point to the GitHub project which we will work on in this
MGS-2022 course.
How we will edit code in the GitHub project is describe in Section~\ref{sec.gitpod}.

You must create an account on GitHub (if you don't have one already).  This will be done
in Section~\ref{sec.coding.1}.




\subsection{GitPod}\label{sec.gitpod}

Most people install software such as IDEs (integrated development
environments), editors, compiler, language implementations, version
control software, onto their personal computer or laptop.   You are free
to do that when you return home.  But for the entirety of MGS-2022, we'll
use a development environment entirely on the cloud.

We will use a web based service called, GitPod to provide an
environment for working with GitHub.  This environment and all the
code you develop will still be available to you after MGS-2022 is
finished.

The GitPod web site is \url{https://www.gitpod.io}.

Figure~\ref{lab.gitpod.env} shows an image of what the development environment looks like.


\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{gitpodenv.png}
  \caption{The GitPod development environment allows devlopers to
    access remote a repository using only a web browser.}\label{lab.gitpod.env}
\end{figure}
You should be able to do all code editing, and collaboration efforts
(push, pull, view history) using this interface.


\subsection{Setting up the environment}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a GitHub account.  This URL,
    \url{https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration}
    explains how to create a GitHub account.  There are many similar
    websites, e.g.,
    \url{https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub}.
    Primarily this is self explanatory at the URL
    \url{https://github.com/join}.
  \item Open \url{https://github.com/jimka2001/mgs-2022} with your web browser.
  \item Fork the repository.
  \item Open the web-ide with gitpod, you may just prepend
    \url{http://gitpod.io/#} to the URL already in the web browser.
  \item Find the Explorer, and open (click) \url{src/main/scala/SetsAndFunctions.scala}.
    If you click on \code{SetsAndFunctions} you should see something like this:

    \includegraphics[height=1.5cm]{rundebug.png}

    Click \textbf{run}.  If you don't see \textbf{run debug}, you may
    need to restart the build server, and recompile.  Find and click
    the Metals icon \includegraphics[height=2cm]{metals.png}.  This
    should open the Metals panel where you can \textbf{Restart the
      build Server} and \textbf{Cascade compile}. 

    \includegraphics[width=8cm]{buildserver.png}

    Thereafter, you should be able to find the \textbf{run|debug} link
    in the Scala code.
  \end{itemize}

\section{Functions}
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Function_machine2.png}
  \caption{Functional programming is about functions.}
\end{figure}

In this unit we will look at functions both from a mathematical
perspective and also from a programming perspective.  There are some
important similarities and some important differences.
\subsection{Mathematical perspective}

We would like to talk about functions.  But where should we start the conversation?

You may already have some intuition about functions.  Sometimes
functions have names, like $\sin$, $\cos$, and $\log$.  Sometimes
functions lack names but have formulas such as
$\frac{x^2-1}{x^2+2x+1}$.

\subsubsection{Specifying functions}

What is a function? A function such as
\[f : X \to Y\]
is a correspondence between two sets.  But it is a special
correspondence.  In particular the function,~$f$, associates a unique,
well-determined, element of~$Y$ with each element of~$X$.
More precisely, if $x\in X$, then~$f(x)$ designates a unique,
well-determined, element of~$Y$.
\[x \in X \implies f(x) \in Y\,.\]

  \caption{A function is a well-defined with all the elements of one set
    (the domain) with some of the elements of another set (the range).}
\end{figure}

Conceptually, a function has three parts
\begin{enumerate}
\item A \emph{domain}, i.e., a place from which input values may be taken.
\item A \emph{range}, i.e., places where output values are found.
\item A \emph{rule}, i.e., a way of determining the output value given only the input value.
\end{enumerate}

To implement a function in the Scala programming language we have to
specify the \emph{domain} and \emph{range} in terms of what are called
\emph{types}, and we designate the \emph{rule} in terms of a
procedure.

\pagebreak
\subsubsection{Mathematical notation}

\begin{align}
  f(x) &= 3x + 1 \label{eq.simple.1}
\end{align}


Let's start with a very simple function~\eqref{eq.simple.1}.
Actually, the only thing specified here is the rule.  This function is
written in a mathematical notation where the domain and range are not
specified.  The same notation can be used for different choices of
domain and range.  For example, this function works for integers,
$\mathbb{Z}$, as input, but it will also work for natural numbers,
$\mathbb{N}$, rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$, real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$,
complex numbers, $\mathbb{C}$.  The same function will also work for
matrices or for functions themselves.


If we want to be more precise, we can use a more descriptive notation as in~\eqref{eq.simple.2}

\begin{align}
  f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}~\text{by}~ f(x) &= 3x + 1 \label{eq.simple.2}
\end{align}


The domain and range of a function need not be the same, and need not
be a set of simple numbers.  For example, we use the symbol
$\mathbb{R}^2$ to denote the set of ordered pairs of real numbers;
i.e.,
\[\{(x,y)\mid x\in \mathbb{R} \wedge y\in\mathbb{R}\}\,.\]
Equation~\eqref{eq.simple.3} shows an example of such a function.

\begin{align}
  f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}~\text{by}~ f(x,y) &= 3x - 2y + 1 \label{eq.simple.3}
\end{align}

Mathematical notation such as $a+b$, $a\times b$, $a-b$, $a^3$, and
$\frac{x^2-1}{x^2+2x+1}$, but we may also specify
functions using cases, like in Equation~\eqref{eq.simple.4}


\begin{equation}\label{eq.simple.4}
  |x| = \begin{cases}
    x &\,; \text{if $x>0$}\\
    0 &\,; \text{if $x=0$}\\
    -x &\,; \text{if $x<0$}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}


\pagebreak
\subsubsection{Specifying functions by recurrence}


Functions can be defined in terms of themselves.  We might use an intuitive definition
such as Equation~\eqref{eq.simple.5}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq.simple.5}
x^n = \underbrace{x \times x \times \ldots \times x}_{n~\text{times}}\,.
\end{equation}

We can define the same function more explicitly by using recursion as in Equation~\eqref{eq.slow.exponent}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq.slow.exponent}
  x^n = \begin{cases}
    1 &\,; \text{if $n=0$}\\
    x \times x^{n-1} &\,; \text{if $n > 0$}\\
    \frac{1}{x^{n}} &\,; \text{if $n < 0$}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}


Similarly, we can define the factorial as
\[n! = 1 \times 2 \times \ldots \times n\]
or we can define it as
\begin{equation}
  n! = \begin{cases}
    1 &\,; \text{if $n=0$}\\
    n \times (n-1)! &\,; \text{if $n > 0$}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The first case need not be $n=0$.  We can define the Fibonacci
numbers.  Let $F(n)$ denote the n'th Fibonacci number.


\begin{equation}
  F(n) = \begin{cases}
    1 &\,; \text{if $n=1$}\\
    1 &\,; \text{if $n=2$}\\
    F(n-1) + F(n-2)  &\,; \text{if $n > 2$}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}



Likewise, we can define the set of subsets of size $n$

\begin{equation}\label{eq.cases.1}
  \mathbb{P}_n(S) = \begin{cases}
    \{\emptyset\} &\,; \text{if $n=0$}\\
    \big\{\{x\} \cup y \mid x \in S, y \in \mathbb{P}_{n-1}(S \setminus \{x\})\big\}  &\,; \text{if $n > 0$}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Notice that Equation~\eqref{eq.cases.1} specifies a function, not of
numbers, but of sets.  Its input is a set, and its output is a set of
sets.  I.e., the domain of $\mathbb{P}_n$ is a set of sets, and its
range is a set of sets of sets.


\subsection{Programming perspective}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Programming languages, functional, imperative

\item Defining a function
  
\item Atomic types: (\code{Double}, \code{Int}, \code{Boolean},
  \code{String}), and operations on objects of these types.

\item Conditionals, pattern matching

\item Recursive functions

\item \code{Tuple}: create and destructure.
  
\item Container types: \code{List[]}, \code{Vector[]}, \code{Seq},
  \code{Set[]}, \code{Map[]}, \code{Option[]}

\item \code{for}, \code{forall}, \code{exists}, \code{contains}, \code{find}  methods.
  
\item We
  implement the \code{fixedSizedSubsets} in live-coding.  We write
  some tests.  Some of which pass, and some of which fail.  To compute
  the number of subsets of size $k$ of a set of size $n$ we need to
  compute~$n \choose k$ using the \code{factorial} function, which you
  will develop.

\item Testing
  
\item Version control, branch, pull
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Functional Programming Languages}

We will not spend much time talking about programming languages which
are not \emph{functional} but very briefly.  Imperative programming
languages tend to model the machine, allowing you to phrase your
programs in a way which the machine can interpret.  Functional
languages, tend to make the machine understand mathematical notations,
which is a more natural and elegant way of thinking.  Functional
languages are often considered more difficult and more exotic.
However, not everyone (including your instructor) agrees that they
need to be considered difficult.


Imperative languages allow you to detail how a computation should be
carried out.  Functional languages allow you describe the problem in
terms of what the solution looks like.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{functionalvsimperative.jpg}
\caption{Imperative vs Functional programming}
\end{figure}

The web site and lots of documentation about the Scala language can be
found here: \url{https://www.scala-lang.org}.  The newest Scala
version is 3.1.x; however, we will use 2.13.8 (or higher).




\clearpage
\subsection{Coding}\label{sec.coding.1}

\begin{enumerate}
\item My First Program, Implement the Quadratic Formula
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Find the function \code{quadraticFormula}, implement a test
    for this function.   The Scala function implements the mathematical
    function $x_{1,2}(a,b,c) = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.  The function computes the roots
    of the polynomial $ax^2 + bx + c$, assuming $a>0$, and assuming $b^2 \geq 4ac$.
    The test should go in the file \texttt{SetsAndFunctionsTestSuite.scala} in
    directory \texttt{src/test/scala/}.  There is
    already a function stub you can use.  Extend the tests.  Remember
    that to test values of type \code{Double} you may need check
    whether the absolute value is less than some threshold ($\varepsilon$) rather than
    testing for exact equivalence.
  \item Enhance \code{quadraticFormula}: Notice that the current
    implementation is inefficient, because it computes almost the same
    thing twice.  Also if you call the function with \code{a,b,c} for
    which there are no real solutions, the function will return
    \code{NaN,NaN}. What is \code{NaN}?  If you don't know, look it up
    with an internet search.  You should refactor the function to
    define a variable \code{discriminant} whose value is
    \[\Delta = b^2 - 4 a c\,.\]
    Then there are three cases, if ${\Delta < 0}$, if ${\Delta = 0}$, and
    if ${\Delta > 0}$. Refactor the function so that if there are no
    real roots it returns an empty list; if there is a unique 
    solution, return a list of one number; and if there are two
    distinct solutions, return a list of those two solutions
    \textbf{in increasing order}.  I.e., if you return \code{(a,b)}
    assure that $a < b$.  Also update the test case to check for
    $a<b$.
  \end{itemize}
\clearpage
\item Recursive Functions
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Implement \code{power} for \code{Int} and \code{Double}.  In
    the case of \code{Double} you should also handle the case of a
    negative exponent.
  \item Implement \code{String} concatenation using the power model.
  \item Implement \code{List} concatenation using the power model.
  \item Implement \code{factorial}.
  \item Use \code{factorial} to test n-sized subsets.  We develop the
    n-sized subsets function in class.

    \textbf{Discussion:} Do we
    need a case for $n=0$ and also $n=1$?  How does this relate to the
    principle of induction?  Look up \emph{Principle of Induction} if
    you need to review it.
  \end{itemize}
\clearpage
\item Fibonacci numbers
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Implement a recursive function such that given $n$ it returns the nth Fibonacci number, $F_n$.
  \item What is the largest Fibonacci number you can compute in Scala?
  \item Search on the internet and find the Binet's formula for computing the nth Fibonacci number.
    Implement this function and compare the results to the recursive implementation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Abstract Algebra}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{galois.png}
\caption{Evariste Galois died at 20 years old as a result of a duel.}
\end{figure}

The story of Evariste Galois, a 20 year old French mathematician who
quickly wrote down the principles of abstract algebra before his death
as a result of a duel, is depicted in several YouTube videos: notably
\emph{Evariste Galois a documentary}
\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6dsanpnpt0} and \emph{Galois
  Theory Explained Simply}
\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct2fyigNgPY}, both produced by
Math Visualized.


In this unit we will study sets with mathematical structure.
There are several mathematical structures defined by axioms.
We will thereafter write programs as individuals and as teams to
manipulate these structures.

\clearpage
\subsection{Mathematical perspective}


\subsubsection{Monoid}
\begin{definition}[Monoid]
$(S,\circ)$ is called a \emph{monoid} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item Closure: $a,b \in S \implies a\circ b \in S$.
\item Associative: $a,b,c \in S \implies (a\circ b) \circ c = a \circ (b \circ c)$
\item Identity: $\exists e\in S$ such that $a\in S \implies a\circ e = e\circ a = a$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent Notice that we assume that a monoid has an identity element, but we
don't assume that it is unique.  Can a monoid have more than one
identity element: $e_1$ and $e_2$?  The answer is no, but why?  

Examples of monoids.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ under addition.

\item The positive integers, ${\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}}$, under multiplication.

\item The positive real numbers under multiplication, ${(\mathbb{R},\times)}$.

  In the clock multiplication monoid, $12$ has the property that
  ${1 \times a = a\times 1 = a}$ for every ${a\in\{1,2,\ldots,12\}}$.

  

\item Let $\Sigma$ be any set of distinguishable elements: ${\Sigma = \{a,b,c,d\}}$.
  Now consider the set, ${\mathcal{L}(\Sigma)}$, of all finite sequences
  $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ for which $x_i \in \Sigma$ for $i=1, 2, \ldots, n$.
  I.e., ${\mathcal{L}(\Sigma)}$ includes all sequences
  of length 12, and all sequences of length 54, and all sequences of length 10,051, etc.

  Let $+$ denote sequence concatenation.  E.g.,
  \[(a,c,a,a) + (d,a,c,a,b) = (a,c,a,a,d,a,c,a,b)\,.\]
  ${\mathcal{L}(\Sigma)}$ is a monoid.

  What is its identity element.

  Is it a commutative monoid?
  
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Group}

An notable property missing from a monoid is the ability solve equations.  As an example,
take the 12-clock above.  Which of these equations can be solved:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Solve for $a$ in $a\times 3 = 7$.
\item Solve for $b$ in $4\times b = 8$.
\item Solve for $c$ in $7\times c = 11$.
\end{enumerate}

To solve such an equation we need to be able to find an inverse with
respect to the operation of the monoid.  Essential to the idea
of inverse is that an inverse be unique.

A monoid for which every element has a uniquie inverse is called
a group.


\begin{definition}[Group]
$(S,\circ)$ is called a \emph{group} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(S,\circ)$ is a monoid.
\item Inverse: $\forall a\in S~\exists a^{-1}\in S$ such that $a\circ a^{-1} = a^{-1} \circ a = e$
\end{enumerate}
If $a\circ b = b\circ a$ for all $a,b\in S$, then we call S an \emph{Abelian} group.
\end{definition}


A group has an identity which is also the identity of the monoid,
which we already know to be unique.  But we can ask a similar
uniqueness question about the inverse.  Can an element $a\in S$ have
two different inverses?  No, but why?

\noindent Examples of groups.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The set of integers, ${\mathbb{Z} = \{0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots\}}$, is a group under
integer addition.   Why?
\begin{itemize}
\item $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ is a monoid with $0$ being the identity.
\item If $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ there exists $b\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $a+b=0$.  E.g.   ${12 + (-12) = 0}$
\end{itemize}

\item Imagine a clock going from 1 to 11, rather than 1 to 12.
  Similar to the clock monoid seen above, here is the multiplication
  table of the strange 11-clock.
  
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
      * & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 \\
      \hline
\hline 1& 1& 2& 3& 4& 5& 6& 7& 8& 9& 10& 11\\
\hline 2& 2& 4& 6& 8& 10& 1& 3& 5& 7& 9& 11\\
\hline 3& 3& 6& 9& 1& 4& 7& 10& 2& 5& 8& 11\\
\hline 4& 4& 8& 1& 5& 9& 2& 6& 10& 3& 7& 11\\
\hline 5& 5& 10& 4& 9& 3& 8& 2& 7& 1& 6& 11\\
\hline 6& 6& 1& 7& 2& 8& 3& 9& 4& 10& 5& 11\\
\hline 7& 7& 3& 10& 6& 2& 9& 5& 1& 8& 4& 11\\
\hline 8& 8& 5& 2& 10& 7& 4& 1& 9& 6& 3& 11\\
\hline 9& 9& 7& 5& 3& 1& 10& 8& 6& 4& 2& 11\\
\hline 10& 10& 9& 8& 7& 6& 5& 4& 3& 2& 1& 11\\
\hline 11& 11& 11& 11& 11& 11& 11& 11& 11& 11& 11& 11\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

In this example, we see that the set is NOT a multiplicative group,
because the element 11 has no inverse.  However, every non-11 element
has an inverse.  We can tediously verify the existence of a unique
inverse for every non-11 element.

The set of non-11 elements of the 11-clock is a multiplicative group
with the following multiplication table.

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
      * & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
      \hline
\hline 1& 1& 2& 3& 4& 5& 6& 7& 8& 9& 10\\
\hline 2& 2& 4& 6& 8& 10& 1& 3& 5& 7& 9\\
\hline 3& 3& 6& 9& 1& 4& 7& 10& 2& 5& 8\\
\hline 4& 4& 8& 1& 5& 9& 2& 6& 10& 3& 7\\
\hline 5& 5& 10& 4& 9& 3& 8& 2& 7& 1& 6\\
\hline 6& 6& 1& 7& 2& 8& 3& 9& 4& 10& 5\\
\hline 7& 7& 3& 10& 6& 2& 9& 5& 1& 8& 4\\
\hline 8& 8& 5& 2& 10& 7& 4& 1& 9& 6& 3\\
\hline 9& 9& 7& 5& 3& 1& 10& 8& 6& 4& 2\\
\hline 10& 10& 9& 8& 7& 6& 5& 4& 3& 2& 1\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

\item Equivalence classes: if $(G,\circ)$ and $(H,\circ)$ are groups and $h$ is a
  function, ${h:G\to H}$, with the property that
  $h(a\circ b) = h(a)\circ h(b)$, then $h$ divides $G$ into equivalence classes.

  The set of such equivalence classes, $G/h$, is also a group.

  For example, take the additive 12-clock group whose addition table is as follows.

    Let $H = \{1,2,3,4\}$ and let $h:G\to H$ by $h(a)=3\times a$,
    where $\times$ is understood to be 12-clock multiplication.
    I.e.,
    ${h(1) = 3}$,
    ${h(2) = 6}$,
    ${h(3) = 9}$,
    ${h(4) = 12}$,
    ${h(5) = 3}$,
    ${h(6) = 6}$,
    ${h(7) = 9}$,
    ${h(8) = 12}$,
    ${h(9) = 3}$,
    ${h(10) = 6}$,
    ${h(11) = 9}$,
    ${h(12) = 12}$
    
    The function, $h$, partitions $G$ into 4 equivalence classes
    \[G/h = \big\{\{1,5,9\},\{2,6,10\},\{3,7,11\},\{4,8,12\}\big\}\,.\]
    Each equivalence contains the elements for which $h$ has the same
    value. I.e., \\
    ${h(1) = h(5) = h(9) = 3}$,\\
    ${h(2) = h(6) = h(10) = 6}$,\\
    ${h(3) = h(7) = h(11) = 9}$, and \\
    ${h(4) = h(8) = h(12) = 12}$.
    
    The addition table for $G/h$ is the following.
    
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|}
      + & \{1,5,9\} & \{2,6,10\} & \{3,7,11\} & \{4,8,12\}\\
      \hline
      \hline \{1,5,9\} & \{2,6,10\} & \{3,7,11\} & \{4,8,12\} & \{1,5,9\}\\
      \hline \{2,6,10\} & \{3,7,11\}& \{4,8,12\} & \{1,5,9\} & \{2,6,10\} \\
      \hline \{3,7,11\} & \{4,8,12\}& \{1,5,9\}& \{2,6,10\}& \{3,7,11\} \\
      \hline \{4,8,12\} & \{1,5,9\} & \{2,6,10\}& \{3,7,11\} & \{4,8,12\} \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}


We can notice that the identity element is ${\{4,8,12\}}$ and that every element has an inverse:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\{1,5,9\}^{-1} = \{3,7,11\}$
  \item $\{2,6,10\}^{-1} = \{2,6,10\}$
  \item $\{3,7,11\}^{-1} = \{1,5,9\}$
  \item $\{4,8,12\}^{-1} = \{4,8,12\}$
\end{itemize}


\end{enumerate}


\clearpage
\subsubsection{Ring}

\begin{definition}[Ring]
$(S,+,\times)$ is called a \emph{ring} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(S,+)$ is an Abelian group.
\item $(S,\times)$ is a monoid.
\item Distributive: $a,b,c  \in S \implies a\times(b+c)=(a\times b)+(a\times c)$.
\end{enumerate}    

\noindent In the special case that $(S,\times)$ is commutative, $(S,+,\times)$ is called an Abelian ring.
\end{definition}

\noindent Examples of rings.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The integers $(\mathbb{Z},+,\times)$
\item The set of $n\times n$ matrices.
\item The set of polynomials with integer coefficients such as ${3x^4+2x^2-5x+1}$.
\item The set of 8-bit sequences (bytes) consisting of 0 and 1, such as 00101101,
  with the two operations AND and XOR, defined bitwise using the following tables.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c||c|c|}
      XOR & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
\hline0& 0& 1\\
\hline1& 1& 0\\
\hline
\end{tabular}\quad\quad
    \begin{tabular}{c||c|c|}
      AND & 0 & 1 \\
      \hline
\hline0& 0& 0\\
\hline1& 0& 1\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
  
For example
\begin{itemize}
\item 00101101 XOR 00110011 = 00011110
\item 00101101 AND 00110011 = 00100001
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\clearpage
\subsubsection{Field}

\begin{definition}[Field]
$(F,+,\times)$ is called a \emph{field} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(F,+, \times)$ is an Abelian Ring.
\item $(F \setminus 0, \times)$ is a (Abelian) group, where $0$ is the identity under $+$.
\end{enumerate}    
\end{definition}


\noindent Some notable examples of fields:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$.
\item The set of $2\times 2$ matrices of the form $\begin{bmatrix}a&-b\\b&a\end{bmatrix}$ where $a,b\in\mathbb{Q}$.
\item The integers modulo any prime such as $7$.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
      $+$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline0& 0& 1& 2& 3& 4& 5& 6\\
\hline1& 1& 2& 3& 4& 5& 6& 0\\
\hline2& 2& 3& 4& 5& 6& 0& 1\\
\hline3& 3& 4& 5& 6& 0& 1& 2\\
\hline4& 4& 5& 6& 0& 1& 2& 3\\
\hline5& 5& 6& 0& 1& 2& 3& 4\\
\hline6& 6& 0& 1& 2& 3& 4& 5\\
\hline
\end{tabular}\quad\quad
    \begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
      $\times$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0\\
\hline1& 0& 1& 2& 3& 4& 5& 6\\
\hline2& 0& 2& 4& 6& 1& 3& 5\\
\hline3& 0& 3& 6& 2& 5& 1& 4\\
\hline4& 0& 4& 1& 5& 2& 6& 3\\
\hline5& 0& 5& 3& 1& 6& 4& 2\\
\hline6& 0& 6& 5& 4& 3& 2& 1\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

With these addition and multiplication tables we can tediously verify
that
\begin{itemize}
\item $0$ is the additive identity.
\item $1$ is the multiplicitive identity.
\item Every element has an additive inverse.
\item Every non-zero element has a multiplicitive inverse.
\item Addition and multiplication are associative.
\item Addition and multiplication are commutative.
\item The distributive property holds.
\end{itemize}

\item The set $\mathbb{Q}\{\sqrt{2}\} = \{a+b\sqrt{2} \mid a,b\in\mathbb{Q}\}$
  is a field.   Moreover, each of the following can be expressed in the same form ${a+b\sqrt{2}}$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $(a_1 + b_1\sqrt{2}) + (a_2 + b_2\sqrt{2})$
  \item $(a_1 + b_1\sqrt{2}) - (a_2 + b_2\sqrt{2})$
  \item $(a_1 + b_1\sqrt{2}) \times (a_2 + b_2\sqrt{2})$
  \item {\Large $\frac{a_1 + b_1\sqrt{2}}{a_2 + b_2\sqrt{2}}$}, provided $a_2,b_2$ are not both 0.
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Summary of Algebraic Structures}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Algebraic-structures-magma-to-group.png}
%%\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid#/media/File:Magma_to_group4.svg} by Ethaniel, Wikipedia.}
\caption{There are many algebraic structures which are linked by subset relations.}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A \emph{monoid} is a set where we can add.
\item A \emph{group} is a set where we can add and subtract.
\item A \emph{ring} is a set where we can add, subtract, and multiply.
\item A \emph{field} is a set where we can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
\end{enumerate}

For simplicity we omit the formal definition of \emph{semi-ring} which is a
set in which we can add and multiply, but not necessarily subtract and divide.

These summaries are vague.  For example when we say ``add'' in a
monoid, the actual multiplication may be addition, multiplication,
concatenation, or many other operations depending on the actual
monoid.  The distinction between adding and multiplying requires that
both exist, thus they can only be distinguished in a semi-ring.

If a set has both a $1$ and a $0$ then dividing by $0$ does not make
sense.  For example, in a field, we require all non-zero elements to
have and multiplicative inverse even though all elements have an
additive inverse.


\subsubsection{Fast Exponentiation in a Monoid and in a Group}

Recall the definition of exponentiation in
Equation~\eqref{eq.slow.exponent}.  In any monoid with operation $\circ$ and identity
element $e$, we can compute an
integer power of an element more efficiently according to the
following formula.



\begin{equation}
  x^n = \begin{cases}
    e &\,; \text{if $n=0$}\\
    x &\,; \text{if $n=1$}\\
    x \circ x^{n-1} &\,; \text{if $n$ is odd}\\
    (x^\frac{n}{2})\circ     (x^\frac{n}{2}) &\,; \text{if $n$ is even}\\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}\label{eq.fast.exponent}

If the monoid is also group, then inverse elements exist, so we can
talk about \emph{negative} exponents in the sense that $x^{-n} =
(x^{-1})^n = (x^n)^{-1}$, in which case we can compute positive and
negative powers efficiently.  Either we compute $x^{|n|}$ and then
compute its inverse, or we can compute $x^{-1}$ and then raise that to
the power of $|n|$.

\begin{equation}
  x^n = \begin{cases}
    e &\,; \text{if $n=0$}\\
    x &\,; \text{if $n=1$}\\
    x \circ x^{n-1} &\,; \text{if $n>0$ is odd}\\
    (x^\frac{n}{2})\circ     (x^\frac{n}{2}) &\,; \text{if $n>0$ is even}\\
    (x^{-1})^{|n|} &\,; \text{if $n<0$}\\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}\label{eq.fast.exponent.group}

\subsection{Coding}\label{sec.coding.2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \code{Map[]} type.  Partition a sequence into equivalence classes in several ways.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Group strings by length of string (size).
  \item Group sets of integers by minimum element.
  \item Partition a set of natural numbers between to boundaries
    \code{lower} and \code{upper} into equivalence classes modulo \code{n}.
  \end{itemize}
  
\item Square matrices of integers
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Implement matrix, add, subtract, multiply multiplication, in
    functions \code{matrixAdd}, \code{matrixSubtract}, and
    \code{matrixMultiple}.

  \item Implement fast monoid multiply for matrices:
    \code{matrixPower}.  Do this in two different ways: by repeated
    multiplication (compute $M^n$ as a result of $n-1$
    multiplications), and again using \code{fastPower}.  How do you
    specify the monoidic arguments (multiplication and unit) for
    \code{matrixPower} using \code{fastPower}.

  \item Test your code using \code{scalatest}. In the test case,
    multiply the slow way and assert that the result is the same as
    \code{matrixPower}.  Can you experimentally determine the time
    needed to raise a large $m\times m$ matrix to the $n$th power
    using the two algorithms?  To find out how to compute the time spent
    in a scala function, do an internet search.

  \item Use the \code{matrixPower} function to compute any three
    consecutive Fibonacci numbers: $F_{n-1}$, $F_{n}$, and $F_{n+1}$,

    Do these results agree with those you computed in unit 1?

  \item You now have three ways to compute Fibonacci numbers.  
    Devise an experiment to determine which of the approaches is
    faster in terms of execution time?

\item Team Project

  \item Implement functions to detect monoid, group,
    ring, and field given a finite set, and the $+$ and $\cdot$
    operations.
  \item When finished with your function, commit, push, and send a
    pull request.
  \item To test your code, you will need to pull the changes in the
    repository.
  \item Define $\mathbb{Z}/n$, the integers modulo $n$. Is it a
    monoid? Is it a group (Abelian)? etc. \ldots
  \item For which values of $n$ is $\mathbb{Z}/n$ a field?
  \end{itemize}
  
\item Group Interactive Project
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Implement the polynomial ring, with addition,
    subtraction, multiplication
  \item Can you implement \code{polynomialPower} using
    \code{fastPower}.  Is it faster than an iterative implementation?
  \item Generalize to the polynomial ring over a given field.
  \item Consider the set of polynomials of degree $n$ whose scalars
    are the field $\mathbb{Z}/p$.  Demonstrate addition, subtraction,
    and multiplication.

    
  \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Discussion:} Is the set of polynomials of degree $n$ with
    integer coefficients an infinite
    set or finite set?  Is this set closed under addition?  Are
    multiplication and addition associative and commutative? Is it
    closed under multiplication?  Does this set form a monoid, group,
    ring, or field?

    How does the answer change if addition and multiplication of
    coefficients is done in $\mathbb{Z}/(n+1)$.

    What if arithmetic on not only coefficients but also exponents is
    done in $\mathbb{Z}/(n+1)$.
    
    What would you need to do to use the library you've written
    \code{isMonoid}, \code{isGroup} etc to test your hypotheses?  How
    would you write a program to generate all such polynomials?

    \textbf{Discussion:} Is the set of $n\times n$ matrices with
    integer content a finite or infinite set?  What if we restrict the
    content to $\mathbb{Z}/(n+1)$?  How would you need to change the
    matrix manipulation code you've already written to accommodate
    arithmetic in $\mathbb{Z}/(n+1)$?
  


\item Complex numbers using matrices (Optional)\\ The complex numbers,
  $\mathbb{C}$, are an extension of the real numbers which allows us,
  among other things, to represent $i = \sqrt{-1}$ and consequently to
  represent roots of polynomials such as $x^2 + 1 = (x+i)\times(x-i)$.
  A complex number, can be expressed as $a + bi$ with $a$ being the
  real part and $b$ being the imaginary part.  Together $a+bi$ is a
  complex number.
    
    An alternate way of representing a complex number is as a $2\times 2$ matrix.
    \[a + ib = \begin{bmatrix}a&-b\\b&a\end{bmatrix}\]

  \begin{itemize}
      
  \item Verify anecdotally by constructing 4 concentric loops
    that
      \[(a_1 + i b_1)\times (a_2 + i b_2) = (a_2 + i b_2)\times (a_1 + i b_1)\,.\]

      Use the matrix multiply function you implemented previously.
      
    \item Verify anecdotally that $i^2 = -1$.  What does this mean in
      terms of the matrix representation?
      
    \item \textbf{Discussion:} in which cases regarding matrices and complex
      numbers can we check associativity and commutativity?  Is matrix
      addition commutative?  Is matrix multiplication commutative?  Is
      complex multiplication commutative?
      
    \item \textbf{Discussion:}    If matrix multiplication is not commutative, but complex
      multiplication is, why can we implement complex numbers in terms
      of matrices?

In this section we will talk about a characteristic property/attribute
which distinguishes the rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$, from the real
numbers, $\mathbb{R}$.  That important feature of $\mathbb{R}$ not
shared by $\mathbb{Q}$ is \emph{convergence}.  But what do we mean by
convergence?

We will discuss the mathematical definition of convergence, and we
will write some programs which approximate real quantities with
sequences which approximate them.

Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz invented calculus around 1660 or
1670.  Some 150 years later, around 1820 Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Bernard Bolzano
presented the concept of the limit.  Thanks to the work of Cauchy and Bolzano and
his contemporaries, we can understand at a fundamental level, the work
of Newton and Leibniz.

\subsection{Mathematical perspective}

In the previous sections we talked
about the natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}$, the integers, $\mathbb{Z}$,
the rationals, and $\mathbb{Q}$.  In particular we talked about what
distinguishes them from each other.

In an intuitive sense:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathbb{N}$ is a set where we can add and
multiply; \item $\mathbb{Z}$ is a set where we can add, subtract, and
multiply; and \item $\mathbb{Q}$ is a set where we can add, subtract,
multiply, and divide.
\end{itemize}

Unfortunately, we don't have a good example of \textbf{numbers} where
we can add but not multiply; however, we saw examples of so-called
monoids such as simple sets where the union operation is associative,
the empty set, $\emptyset$, is the identity element, but there is no
inverse operation of union, and nothing like multiplication.  



\subsubsection{Intuition of  convergence?}

In Figure~\ref{fig.circle.perim} we can convince ourselves that the
circumference of the circle is a fixed
quantity.  I.e., it is not an vague, indefinite concept, but the
circumference of a circle has a real, actual, definite length.


\begin{figure}
\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Archimedes-pi.png}
%%\footnote{\url{https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1250248}. By

%%Archimedes pi.png:  by Fredrik, Public Domain.}
\caption{The length of the circumference of the circle is bounded between the
lengths of the various polygonal perimeters.}
\label{fig.circle.perim}
\end{figure}

The length of the circumference of the circle is always greater than the
length of the perimeter of an inscribed polygon, and is always less
than the length of the perimeter of a circumscribed polygon.
Moreover, we have a decreasing sequence of numbers and an increasing
sequence of numbers which grow arbitrarily close together.  I.e.,
choose any small number, $\varepsilon$.  Now find a sufficiently large
n such that the perimeter of the circumscribed n-sided polygon is within
$\varepsilon$ of the perimeter of the inscribed polygon.  The
sandwiched value is the circumference of the circle.

The real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$, is the smallest set which contains all these numbers.
\[\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}\]
\[\mathbb{R} \not\subset \mathbb{Q}\]


As another example, using infinite sums which we will talk about in a
later unit, consider the sequence: $(a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots)$, such
that $a_n$ is defined as:
\[a_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{8}{(4k+1)(4k+3)}\]

This sequence is discussed on wikipedia.\footnote{Leibniz formula,
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_pi}}.  This is
a sequence of rational numbers; each numerator is an integer, namely
8, and each denominator is an integer.  The successive rational
numbers, $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ may be made as close as you like by
choosing sufficiently large $n$.  Thus this sequence is Cauchy.
Nevertheless, the value this sequence tends to is not rational.  If you
chose any rational number, $q\in\mathbb{Q}$, then either:
\begin{enumerate}
\item You can find an $N$ such that if $n>N$ then $a_n>q$.
\item You can find an $N$ such that if $n>N$ then $a_n<q$.
\end{enumerate}

  Thus we say that this sequence
does not converge in $\mathbb{Q}$.  However, it converges to in
$\mathbb{R}$.  In particular
\[a_n \to \pi\,.\]



\subsubsection{The limit of a sequence}
The limit is the most fundamental concept in
Calculus.
\[\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = a\]
means that $\forall~\varepsilon > 0~ \exists~ N\in\mathbb{N}$ such
that if $n>N$ then $|a_n - a| < \varepsilon$.


A sequence $\lbrace a\rbrace_n$ converges to $a$, written $a_n\to a$,
if \[\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = a\,.\]
  

A sequence is $\lbrace a\rbrace_n$ is said to be Cauchy, if
$\forall~\varepsilon > 0~ \exists~ N\in\mathbb{N}$
such that if $n>N$ and $m>N$ then $|a_n - a_m| < \varepsilon$.

\subsection{Programming perspective}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item tail recursion,
  \item fixed point
  \item higher order functions
  \item function type
  \item representing finite and infinite sequences.
  \item sequence functions: \code{map}, \code{filter}, \code{max}, \code{sum}, \code{head}, \code{tail}, 
  \item \code{for} comprehension
  \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Coding}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Exponentiation
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Implement exponentiation of Double as a recursive function.
  \item Generalize to implement exponentiation on a monoid
  \item Implement matrix exponentiation.
  \item Implement polynomial exponentiation.
  \end{itemize}  
\item Sequences
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Define a sequence \[a_n =
    \sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{8}{(4k+1)(4k+3)}\,.\] Given $n$, compute the sequence of
    $n+1$ numbers, and use the \code{sum} method to add them up. (We will
    discuss a better way tomorrow).
  \item Compute the same sums using normal recursion and tail recursion.
  \item Convince yourself that $\{a_n\}$ is strictly increasing; i.e.,
    $a_n < a_{n+1}$.  Can you show this empirically? Can you prove
    this mathematically?
  \item However, the sequence of successive
    differences is decreasing: if $d_n = a_{n+1} - a_n$ then the
    sequence $\{d_n\}$ is decreasing: $d_n > d_{n+1}$.  Show this
    empirically and mathematically.
  \end{itemize}
\item Convergence
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Now implement a function such that given $\varepsilon$, find and
    return $N$, such that \[n>N \implies |a_n - \pi| < \varepsilon\,.\]
  \item Detect Cauchy of sequences: write a function such that given a
    sequence in the form of a function, $a$ of an \code{Int} $k$, and
    a \code{Double} $\varepsilon$.  The function should return an
    \code{Int}, $k$, indicating the first value for which $| a_k -
    a_{k+1}| < \varepsilon$.
  \item Use Google or Wikipedia etc, to find another sequence which
    converges to $\pi$.  Use the function you just wrote to
    empirically verify this conversion.
  \item Now you have two sequences which both converge to $\pi$. Does
    the sequence created by averaging the corresponding elements also
    converge?  If so, what does it converge to?  Does it converge
    faster or slower?  Can you devise an experiment to show
    empirically?
  \end{itemize}  
  
\end{enumerate}





\clearpage\section{Infinite sums}

In this section we'll look at ways to compute sums like these
\begin{align}
  \exp(x) &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^k}{k!}\\
  \sin(x) &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{{(-1)}^{k}x^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}\\
  \cos(x) &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{{(-1)}^{k}x^{2k}}{(2k)!} \\
  \ln(1+x) &= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{{(-1)}^{k-1}x^{k}}{k}\,.
\end{align}

  \item Contrast convergence and summability.
  \item Taylor series is of the form
    \[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{n}x^{n}\,.\]
    In some cases this series converges to an interesting function.
    Since the $x^n$ terms are increasing rapidly, the $a_n$ terms must
    therefore decrease (in absolute value) rapidly otherwise the
    series will not converge (it will diverge).

\caption{Intuitively, the derive compute the slope of the line tangent to a curve at a given point.}
\label{lab.deriv.by.tangent.line}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Mathematical perspective} --- We start our discussion of the derivative by talking about the limit.
  We saw the limit already in terms of sequences.  Now we look at a slightly different concept,
  and extension, of the limit in terms of a function of a single variable.
  We will thereafter, define the derivative in terms of the limit.  Additionally, we will follow the same
  model programmatically, by defining a function to estimate the limit, then to implement a function to estimate the derivative using the limit function.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Intuition of limit.  Consider the function:
    \[f(x) = \frac{x-1}{x^2-1}\,.\]
    We cannot evaluate this function at $x=1$; however if we take
    values of $x$ close to $1$, the function evaluates just fine, and
    is well-behaved.  Take a sequence of values approaching 1, and ask
    yourself what value does $f(x)$ approach?

    It turns out that any sequence $a_n \to 1$ (except those for which $a_k = 1$ for some $k$) corresponds
    to a convergent sequence $f(a_n) \to \frac{1}{2}$.

    Another way of phrasing this intuition is that we can make
    $\frac{x-1}{x^2-1}$ close to $\frac{1}{2}$ by making $x$ close to
    $1$.  But that statement is a vague.  We can make the statement
    more precise by saying that we can make $\frac{x-1}{x^2-1}$
    arbitrarily close to $\frac{1}{2}$ by making $x$ sufficiently
    close to $1$.

  \item Definition of limit
    \includegraphics[width=8cm]{limit.png}
%%\footnote{By User:HiTe --- Own
%%    work, Public Domain,
%%    \url{https://commons.wikimedgia.org/w/index.php?curid=2314281}}.

  What does this notation mean? \[\lim_{x\to a}f(x) = L\]
  It means that: $\forall \varepsilon > 0~\exists \delta > 0$ such that
  \[|x - a| < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(a)| < \varepsilon\,.\]
  

  Using the language we used above: the limit of a function $f$ at $a$
  is $L$ means that we can make the value of $f$ arbitrarily close to
  $L$ by making its argument sufficiently close to $a$.

  \item Intuition of derivative

\caption{We may estimate the derivative by a sequence of secent lines which estimate
the tangent line.  The secent lines approach the tangent line in Figure~\ref{lab.deriv.by.tangent.line}.}
\end{figure}

    Again we can generate a sequence of values (of $h\to 0$)
    approaching 0, and from that we can generate a sequence of values
    of the slope of $f$, i.e., $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$.  Does this
    sequence of slopes converge when the sequence of $h$ values
    converges to $0$?


    If $h \to 0$ then does $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ approach some
    value?  The value may very well be different for each $x$.  If so
    that set of values is therefore a function of $x$, which leads to
    the definition of the derivative.
    

\item Definition of derivative
  \[f'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} = \lim_{a\to x}\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}\,.\]
\noindent\includegraphics[width=10cm]{derivative.png}
%% \footnote{\url{https://betterexplained.com/articles/calculus-building-intuition-for-the-derivative} From web page.}


\item Linearity of derivative.
  \[f(x) = h(x) + g(x) \implies f'(x) = h'(x) + g'(x)\,,\]
  and \[f(x) = \alpha h(x) \implies f'(x) = \alpha h'(x)\,.\]

\item Product rule
  \[f(x) = h(x)g(x) \implies f'(x) = f(x)g'(x) + f'(x)g(x)\,.\]
\item Derivative of polynomial using induction and product rule.
  \[f(x) = x^n \implies f'(x) = n x^{n-1}\,.\]
\item Thus we can compute the derivative of any polynomial:
  If \[f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_n x^k\,,\] then \[f'(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} k a_n  x^{k-1}\,.\]

  \end{enumerate}

    So by linearity,
    \begin{align}
      \int \sum_{k=0}^{n}a_k x^n~dx &= \sum_{k=0}^{n} \int a_k x^n~dx\\
      & = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k \int x^n~dx\\
      &= \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{a_k}{n+1} x^{n+1}\,.

  \item Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item The derivative of the integral is the function.

    \end{align}
  \item The integral of the derivative is the function.
    \begin{align}
      F'(x) = f(x) & \implies \int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\\
