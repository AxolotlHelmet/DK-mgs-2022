\section{Objectives}


You are a scholar participating in the 2022 Mississippi Governor's
School major course Advanced Mathematical Concepts, and Functional
Programming.  There are several objectives of this course:
\begin{description}
  \item[Mathematics] to develop
or ameliorate their love for Mathematics
\item[Computer Science] to learn about functional
programming by applying programming principles to mathematical
principles which you'll learn along the way,
\item[Communication] to reinforce your ability and confidence to
  explain and defend your ideas
\end{description}

In this course you will learn many cursory things along the fast
and hectic journey.  It is critical that the leaders of tomorrow,
especially the leaders in the technology sector, understand the impact
on humans of technological development, especially decisions made in
haste under project pressure.  These aspects include knowing how to
apply abstract concepts to real computation problems, and how to
explain their ideas and defend their decisions to their peers.
Scientific discussions can sometimes become heated and experts might
disagree about the best course of action.  We'll learn to keep
disagreements objective and use science to test ideas, rather than
relying on emotions.

It is my belief that you don't understand something until you can
explain it.  Additionally, many ideas are lost because the developer
neglected to share his ideas.  After each unit, some students will
present their solutions to their peers.  This means defending your
choices, recognizing strengths and shortcomings, and being subjected
to peer review (important in the scientific process).  This exercise
is intended not only to learn to accept constructive criticism but
also to build confidence.

\section{Overview}

The scholars will proceed through up to 6 units, perhaps fewer if we
decide to dig deeper into particular ones.  Each unit will be
organized into three stages
\begin{itemize}
\item Theory --- Learn mathematics and computer science concepts.
\item Lab --- Implement code relating to the theory and link it to
  previous units.
\item Presentation --- Present your work to your classmates, and
  defend your decisions.
  \end{itemize}

\includegraphics[height=4cm]{scala-programming.jpg}

In terms of mathematics, we will primarily cover introductions to
Set Theory, Abstract Algebra, and Calculus.  Starting with Set Theory will allow
us to write conceptually simple programs while learning the
development environment, the programming language, and the
collaboration model.  Additionally, Abstract Algebra and Calculus are
fields of study you may continue pursuing the rest of your life.


  
We will use a functional programming language called Scala,
\url{https://www.scala-lang.org}.  Functional languages are considered
by some to be more difficult than imperative languages, and students
rarely start programming using a functional.  We have chosen this
approach, because the approach we will take will parallel many
mathematical concepts.  You will be able to take the things you've
learned and apply them back to other (more popular) programming
languages such as Python, Java Script, C++, etc.

\section{Syllabus}


\subsection{Sets and Functions}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Venn-A-intersect-B.png}
\footnote{By Ethaniel --- \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid#/media/File:Magma_to_group4.svg}, CC0, \url{https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=98106965}.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mathematical perspective
\begin{enumerate}
\item Definition of set.

\item Axioms of sets, empty set, element relation, subset relation, union,
intersection, complement, power set, comprehension, Cartesian product

\item Definition of function.

\item logical operators, existence $\exists$, for all $\forall$, implies $\implies$.

  Propositions about sets can use various forms of syntax.
  Which of the following implications true?
  \begin{align}
    n \in \mathbb{Z}\quad&\implies n + 1 > n\\
    n \in \mathbb{Z}\quad&\implies n^2 > n\\
    n \in \mathbb{Z}\quad&\implies n^2 \geq n
  \end{align}
  These implications are equivalent to the following form which has a slightly different intuition.
  \begin{align}
    \forall n \in \mathbb{Z}\quad& n + 1 > n\\
    \forall n \in \mathbb{Z}\quad& n^2 > n\\
    \forall n \in \mathbb{Z}\quad& n^2 \geq n\\
  \end{align}
  Rather than claiming something is true for every element of a set, we might also wish to claim
  that something is true for some element or elements of the set.  
  \begin{align}
    \exists n \in \mathbb{Z}\quad& n + 1 > n\label{eq.a1}\\    
    \exists n \in \mathbb{Z}\quad& n^2 > n\label{eq.a2}\\
    \exists n \in \mathbb{Z}\quad& n^2 \geq n\label{eq.a3}
  \end{align}
  To say something is true for some element is equivalent to saying it
  does not fail for every element.  This can be confusing in human
  languages.  I can say ``Every car on the street is green,'' and
  everyone understand. However, if I say, ``Every care on the street
  is not green'' say, the some people will think ``No car is green,''
  while others might think ``At least one car is not green.''  These
  are very different claims.  And in mathematics we need a way to
  construct both such claims, unambiguously.

  The proposition \[\exists x\in S \quad P(x)\] is
  equivalent to saying it is false that $\forall x\in S \text{~we
    have~} \neg P(x)$.  That is to say,

  \[\big(\exists x\in S \quad P(x)\big)
  \iff
  \neg\big(\forall x\in S \quad\neg P(x)\big)\,.
  \]

  Thus statements~\eqref{eq.a1}, \eqref{eq.a2},
  and~\eqref{eq.a3} are respectively equivalent to the following.
  
  \begin{align}
    \neg ~\big(~n \in \mathbb{Z}\quad & \implies \neg~ (n+1 > n)   ~\big)\label{eq.110}\\
    \neg ~\big(~n \in \mathbb{Z}\quad & \implies \neg~ (n^2 > n)   ~\big)\label{eq.111}\\
    \neg ~\big(~n \in \mathbb{Z}\quad & \implies \neg~ (n^2 \geq n)~\big)\label{eq.112}
  \end{align}
  
  The inner logical negations $\neg~ (n+1 > n) $, $\neg~ (n^2 > n)$,
  and $\neg~ (n^2 \geq n)$ are tricky for the human to understand, but
  if you think about them, they are simply: $(n+1 \leq n)$, $(n^2 \leq n)$,
  and $(n^2 < n)$.  So the following three propositions
  are again equivalent to~\eqref{eq.a1}, \eqref{eq.a2},
  and~\eqref{eq.a3} and easier to understand.


  \begin{align}
    \neg ~\big(~n \in \mathbb{Z}\quad & \implies n+1\leq n~\big)\\
    \neg ~\big(~n \in \mathbb{Z}\quad & \implies n^2 \leq n~\big)\\
    \neg ~\big(~n \in \mathbb{Z}\quad & \implies n^2 < n~\big)
  \end{align}
\item Intuition and definition using Cartesian
product.  Injection, surjection, inverse function, isomorphism.

\subsection{Abstract Algebra --- Sets with mathematical structure}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Algebraic-structures-magma-to-group.png}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mathematical perspective
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Several mathematical structures defined by axioms
    \begin{description}
    \item[Monoid:] $(S,\circ)$ is a monoid if
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Closure: $a,b \in S \implies a\circ b \in S$.
      \item Associative: $a,b,c \in S \implies (a\circ b) \circ c = a \circ (b \circ c)$
      \item Identity: $\exists e\in S$ such that $a\in S \implies a\circ e = e\circ a = a$
      \end{enumerate}
      
    \item[Group:] $(S,\circ)$ is a group if
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item $(S,\circ)$ is a monoid.
      \item Inverse: $\forall a\in S~\exists a^{-1}\in S$ such that $a\circ a^{-1} = a^{-1} \circ a = e$
      \end{enumerate}
      If $a\circ b = b\circ a$ for all $a,b\in S$, then we call S and Abelian group.
      
    \item[Ring:] $(S,+,\times)$ is a ring if
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item $(S,+)$ is an Abelian group.
      \item $(S,\times)$ is a monoid.
      \item Distributive: $a,b,c  \in S \implies a\times(b+c)=(a\times b)+(a\times c)$.
      \end{enumerate}    
      
      In the special case that $(S,\times)$ is commutative, $(S,+,\times)$ is called an Abelian ring.
      
    \item[Field:] $(F,+,\times)$ is a field if
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item $(F,+)$ is an Abelian group
      \item $(F, \times)$ commutative monoid.
      \item $(F \setminus 0, \times)$ is an Abelian group, where $0$ is the identity under $+$.
      \end{enumerate}    
    \end{description}
  \item Optional
    \begin{description}
    \item[Vector Space:] $(G,F,+,\times,\circ)$ is a vector space if
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item $(G,+)$ is an Abelian group.
      \item $(F,+,\cdot)$ is a field.
      \item $a,b\in F$ and $v\in G$, we have $(a + b)\circ v = a\circ v + b\circ v$.
      \item $a\in F$ and $u,v\in G$, we have $a\circ (u + v) = (a\circ v) + (a\circ v)$.
      \item $a,b\in F$ and $v\in G$, we have $(a\cdot b)\circ v = a\circ (b \circ v)$.
      \end{enumerate}    
      Elements of $G$ are called vectors.  Elements of $F$ are called
      scalars. And $\circ$ (normally written as juxtaposition, $av$ rather than $a\circ v$) is
      called scalar multiplication.
      
    \end{description}

    \item Review of definitions: associative, commutative, Abelian,
      distributive, closure, identity, vector, scalar, scalar
      multiplication, juxtaposition.
      
    \item Fuzzy definitions: zero, one, add, multiply

  \item Ring of matrix (matrix add, subtract, multiply)
  \item \code{Map[Int,Double]} type (polynomial as motivating example)
  \item Field of polynomials (polynomial add, scale, subtract, multiply)
  \item Property based testing
  \item Team work projects using git and github, pull request, merge.

    \item Generalize to partition based on equivalence of probe function.
    \item Rewrite step 1 in terms of 2
    \item Partition a set of natural numbers form $0$ to $n$ into equivalence classes modulo $m$.
    \end{itemize}

      multiplication.  
    \item Test structural axioms (commutativity etc), Property based testing.
    \item Complex numbers as special case of $2\times 2$ matrix.

    \item Consider the set of polynomials of degree $n$ whose scalars
      are the field $\mathbb{Z}/p$.  Demonstrate addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
    \end{itemize}

  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

  
\pagebreak\subsection{Convergence} In the previous sections we talked
about the natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}$, the integers, $\mathbb{Z}$,
the rationals, and $\mathbb{Q}$.  In particular we talked about what
distinguishes them from each other.

In an intuitive sense:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathbb{N}$ is a set where we can add and
multiply; \item $\mathbb{Z}$ is a set where we can add, subtract, and
multiply; and \item $\mathbb{Q}$ is a set where we can add, subtract,
multiply, and divide.
\end{itemize}

Unfortunately, we don't have a good example of \textbf{numbers} where
we can add but not multiply; however, we saw examples of so-called
monoids such as simple sets where the union operation is associative,
the empty set, $\emptyset$, is the identity element, but there is no
inverse operation of union, and nothing like multiplication.  So we
might say a set is somewhere which allows associative addition, but
not subtraction and not multiplication.

In this section we will talk about a characteristic property/attribute which
distinguishes the rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$, from the real
numbers, $\mathbb{R}$.  That important feature of $\mathbb{R}$ not
shared by $\mathbb{Q}$ is \emph{convergence}.  But what do we mean by
convergence?

Look at the following image.  It is easy to convince yourself that the
circumference of the indicated circle with integer radius is a fixed
quantity.  I.e., it is not an vague, indefinite concept, but the
circumference of a circle has a real, actual, definite length.


\noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Archimedes-pi.png}
\footnote{By Original: FredrikVector: Leszek Krupinski --- Own work based on: Archimedes pi.png:  by Fredrik, Public Domain, \url{https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1250248}.}


The
length of the circumference of the circle is always greater than the
length of the perimeter of an inscribed polygon, and is always less
than the length of the perimeter of a circumscribed polygon.
Moreover, we have a decreasing sequence of numbers and an increasing
sequence of numbers which grow arbitrarily close together.  I.e.,
choose any small number, $\varepsilon$.  Now find a sufficiently large
n such that the perimeter of the circumscribed polygon is within
$\varepsilon$ of the perimeter of the inscribed polygon.  The
sandwiched value is the circumference of the circle.

The real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$, is the smallest set which contains all these numbers.
\[\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}\]
\[\mathbb{R} \not\subset \mathbb{Q}\]


As another example, using infinite sums which we will talk about in a later unit, consider the sequence: $(a_0, a_1, a_2, ...)$, such that $a_n$ is defined as:
\[a_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{8}{(4n+1)(4n+3)}\]

This sequence is discussed on wikipedia.\footnote{Leibniz formula,
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_pi}}.  This is
a sequence of rational numbers; each numerator is an integer, namely
8, and each denominator is an integer.  The successive rational
numbers, $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ may be made as close as you like by
choosing sufficiently large $n$.  Thus this sequence is Cauchy.
Nevertheless, the value this sequence tends to is not rational.  Any
rational number, $q$, you chose, you can find an $N$ such that if
$n>N$ then either $a_n>q$ or $a_n<q$.  Thus we say that this sequence
does not converge in $\mathbb{Q}$.  However, it converges to in $\mathbb{R}$.  In particular
\[a_n \to \pi\,.\]


\begin{itemize}
\item Mathematical perspective
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The limit is the most fundamental concept in
    Calculus.
    \[\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = a\] means that $\forall~\varepsilon > 0~ \exists~ N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that if $n>N$ then $|a_n - a| < \varepsilon$.
  \item limits in terms of sequences and
    convergence,
    A sequence $\lbrace a\rbrace_n$ converges to $a$, written $a_n\to a$, if \[\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = a\,.\]

  \item Cauchy vs convergent.
    A sequence is $\lbrace a\rbrace_n$ is said to be Cauchy, if
    $\forall~\varepsilon > 0~ \exists~ N\in\mathbb{N}$
    such that if $n>N$ and $m>N$ then $|a_n - a_m| < \varepsilon$.

    is also for a smaller $\varepsilon_{1}>0$, an index $N_{1}$, so
    that the sequence is afterwards inside the epsilon tube
    $(a-\varepsilon_{1},a+\varepsilon_{1})$.
  \end{enumerate}
  
\item Programming perspective
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item recursion
  \item tail recursion,
  \item fixed point
  \item higher order functions
  \item representing finite and infinite sequences.
  \item sequence functions: \code{map}, \code{filter}, \code{max}, \code{sum}, \code{head}, \code{tail}, 
  \item \code{for} comprehension
  \end{enumerate}

\item Coding

  \item Implement exponentiation of Double as a recursive function.
  \item Generalize to implement exponentiation on a monoid
  \item Implement matrix exponentiation.
  \item Implement polynomial exponentiation.
  \end{itemize}  
\item Sequences
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Define a lazy sequence \[a_n =
    \sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{8}{(4n+1)(4n+3)}\,.\] Given $n$, compute the sequence of
    $n+1$ numbers, and use the \code{sum} method to add them up. (We will
    discuss a better way tomorrow).
  \item Compute the same sums using normal recursion and tail recursion.
  \item Convince yourself that $a_n$ is decreasing; i.e., $a_n >
    a_{n+1}$.  Can you show this empirically? Can you prove this
    mathematically?
  \end{itemize}
\item Convergence
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Now implement a function such that given $\varepsilon$, find and
    return $N$, such that \[n>N \implies |a_n - \pi| < \varepsilon\,.\]
  \item Detect Cauchy of sequences.
  \end{itemize}  
  
\item Implement the limit function as a function which
  manipulates functions.
\end{enumerate}
