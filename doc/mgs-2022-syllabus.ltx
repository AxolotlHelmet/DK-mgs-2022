\section{Objectives}


You are a scholar participating in the 2022 Mississippi Governor's
School major course Advanced Mathematical Concepts, and Functional
Programming.  There are several objectives of this course:
\begin{description}
  \item[Mathematics] to develop
or ameliorate their love for Mathematics
\item[Computer Science] to learn about functional
programming by applying programming principles to mathematical
principles which you'll learn along the way,
\item[Communication] to reinforce your ability and confidence to explain and defend your ideas
\end{description}

In this course you will learn many cursory things along the fast
and hectic journey.  It is critical that the leaders of tomorrow,
especially the leaders in the technology sector, understand the impact
on humans of technological development, especially decisions made in
haste under project pressure.  These aspects include knowing how to
apply abstract concepts to real computation problems, and how to
explain their ideas and defend their decisions to their peers.
Scientific discussions can sometimes become heated and experts might
disagree about the best course of action.  We'll learn to keep
disagreements objective and use science to test ideas, rather than
relying on emotions.

It is my belief that you don't understand something until you can
explain it.  Additionally, many ideas are lost because the developer
neglected to share his ideas.  After each unit, some students will
present their solutions to their peers.  This means defending your
choices, recognizing strengths and shortcomings, and being subjected
to peer review (important in the scientific process).  This exercise
is intended not only to learn to accept constructive criticism but
also to build confidence.


\section{Overview}

The scholars will proceed through up to 6 units, perhaps fewer if we
decide to dig deeper into particular ones.  Each unit will be
organized into three stages
\begin{itemize}
\item Theory --- Learn mathematics and computer science concepts.
\item Lab --- Implement code relating to the theory and link it to
  previous units.
\item Presentation --- Present your work to your classmates, and
  defend your decisions.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Mathematical perspective
  \begin{description}
  \item[Monoid:] $(S,\circ)$ is a monoid if
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Closure: $a,b \in S \implies a\circ b \in S$.
    \item Associative: $a,b,c \in S \implies (a\circ b) \circ c = a \circ (b \circ c)$
    \item Identity: $\exists e\in S$ such that $a\in S \implies a\circ e = e\circ a = a$
    \end{enumerate}

  \item[Group:] $(S,\circ)$ is a group if
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $(S,\circ)$ is a monoid.
    \item Inverse: $\forall a\in S~\exists a^{-1}\in S$ such that $a\circ a^{-1} = a^{-1} \circ a = e$
    \end{enumerate}
    If $a\circ b = b\circ a$ for all $a,b\in S$, then we call S and Abelian group.

  \item[Ring:] $(S,+,\times)$ is a ring if
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $(S,+)$ is an Abelian group.
    \item $(S,\times)$ is a monoid.
    \item Distributive: $a,b,c  \in S \implies a\times(b+c)=(a\times b)+(a\times c)$.
    \end{enumerate}    

    In the special case that $(S,\times)$ is commutative, $(S,+,\times)$ is called an Abelian ring.
    
  \item[Field:] $(F,+,\times)$ is a field if
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $(F,+)$ is an Abelian group
    \item $(F \setminus 0, \times)$ is an Abelian group.
    \item Distributive: $a,b,c  \in S \implies a\times(b+c)=(a\times b)+(a\times c)$
    \end{enumerate}    

  \item[Vector Space:] $(G,F,+,\times,\circ)$ is a vector space if
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $(G,+)$ is an Abelian group.
    \item $(F,+,\cdot)$ is a field.
    \item $a,b\in F$ and $v\in G$, we have $(a + b)\circ v = a\circ v + b\circ v$.
    \item $a\in F$ and $u,v\in G$, we have $a\circ (u + v) = (a\circ v) + (a\circ v)$.
    \item $a,b\in F$ and $v\in G$, we have $(a\cdot b)\circ v = a\circ (b \circ v)$.
  \end{enumerate}    
    Elements of $G$ are called vectors.  Elements of $F$ are called
    scalars. And $\times$ (normally written as juxtaposition) is
    called scalar multiplication.

\pagebreak\subsection{Convergence} In the previous sections we talked
about the natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}$, the integers, $\mathbb{Z}$,
the rationals, and $\mathbb{Q}$.  In particular we talked about what
distinguishes them from each other.

In an intuitive sense:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathbb{N}$ is a set where we can add and
multiply; \item $\mathbb{Z}$ is a set where we can add, subtract, and
multiply; and \item $\mathbb{Q}$ is a set where we can add, subtract,
multiply, and divide.
\end{itemize}

Unfortunately, we don't have a good example of \textbf{numbers} where
we can add but not multiply; however, we saw examples of so-called
monoids such as simple sets where the union operation is associative,
the empty set, $\emptyset$, is the identity element, but there is no
inverse operation of union, and nothing like multiplication.  So we
might say a set is somewhere which allows associative addition, but
not subtraction and not multiplication.

In this section we will talk about a characteristic property/attribute which
distinguishes the rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$, from the real
numbers, $\mathbb{R}$.  That important feature of $\mathbb{R}$ not
shared by $\mathbb{Q}$ is \emph{convergence}.  But what do we mean by
convergence?

Look at the following image.  It is easy to convince yourself that the
circumference of the indicated circle with integer radius is a fixed
quantity.  I.e., it is not an vague, indefinite concept, but the
circumference of a circle has a real, actual, definite length.


\noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Archimedes-pi.png}
\footnote{By Original: FredrikVector: Leszek Krupinski --- Own work based on: Archimedes pi.png:  by Fredrik, Public Domain, \url{https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1250248}.}


The
length of the circumference of the circle is always greater than the
length of the perimeter of an inscribed polygon, and is always less
than the length of the perimeter of a circumscribed polygon.
Moreover, we have a decreasing sequence of numbers and an increasing
sequence of numbers which grow arbitrarily close together.  I.e.,
choose any small number, $\varepsilon$.  Now find a sufficiently large
n such that the perimeter of the circumscribed polygon is within
$\varepsilon$ of the perimeter of the inscribed polygon.  The
sandwiched value is the circumference of the circle.

The real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$, is the smallest set which contains all these numbers.
\[\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}\]
\[\mathbb{R} \not\subset \mathbb{Q}\]


As another example, using infinite sums which we will talk about in a later unit, consider the sequence: $(a_0, a_1, a_2, ...)$, such that $a_n$ is defined as:
\[a_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{8}{(4n+1)(4n+3)}\]

This sequence is discussed on wikipedia.\footnote{Leibniz formula,
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_pi}}.  This is
a sequence of rational numbers; each numerator is an integer, namely
8, and each denominator is an integer.  The successive rational
numbers, $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ may be made as close as you like by
choosing sufficiently large $n$.  Thus this sequence is Cauchy.
Nevertheless, the value this sequence tends to is not rational.  Any
rational number, $q$, you chose, you can find an $N$ such that if
$n>N$ then either $a_n>q$ or $a_n<q$.  Thus we say that this sequence
does not converge in $\mathbb{Q}$.  However, it converges to in $\mathbb{R}$.  In particular
\[a_n \to \pi\,.\]


\begin{itemize}
\item Mathematical perspective
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The limit is the most fundamental concept in
    Calculus.
    \[\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = a\] means that $\forall~\varepsilon > 0~ \exists~ N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that if $n>N$ then $|a_n - a| < \varepsilon$.
  \item limits in terms of sequences and
    convergence,
    A sequence $\lbrace a\rbrace_n$ converges to $a$, written $a_n\to a$, if \[\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = a\,.\]

  \item Cauchy vs convergent.
    A sequence is $\lbrace a\rbrace_n$ is said to be Cauchy, if
    $\forall~\varepsilon > 0~ \exists~ N\in\mathbb{N}$
    such that if $n>N$ and $m>N$ then $|a_n - a_m| < \varepsilon$.
