# The development environment

## Entering the development environment for the first time

You'll need to create a github account if you don't already have one.

to create a github account.</a>

<p>For a github account, you'll need an email address where you can
receive email, and you'll need to choose an avatar name which could be
your real name or some decorated or embellished form of your name, or
could be something completely different.  It is a name other nerds
will refer to you in the future.  Naming is hard.

Once you have a github account you may launch your workspace.

## Launch the gitpod workspace

Prepend <tt>http://gitpod.io/#</tt> to the URL of this page to launch a workspace.

## How to make your changes visible to the world.

The Metals plugin allows you to interface with github.
